# React news SPA - powered by News API

This is a SPA to display current news based on a user's query, top stories, or other parameters which will be listed below. Currently don't have a direction with this app because this is mainly to keep busy.

## Dependencies
<ul>
<li>React</li>
<li>Gulp</li>
<li>News API</li>
</ul>

## Possible Queries

Don't have a list yet. I will figure this out as I build it. The intention is to be open ended and allow the user to search freely or with pre-defined CTAs. Maybe both... who knows.

## Status

Dev started today - 5/31/2018.

Currently building out the functionality and tie-ins with the News API.
